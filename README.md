### Ãœdv! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

My name is Katalin. I am a full-stack software engineer, currently working with Python at Pinwheel API. 
<br>

I thrive in environments where I am continually being asked to learn and have a sense of ownership over the given product or service. I feel especially rewarded when I know that my work is having a direct, positive impact on someone else's day - be that an employee of a company where new technologies are being implemented or an end-user of an application. Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team that has great mentorship and diversity.

### My Relevant Work Experience

**SOFTWARE ENGINEER, INTEGRATIONS | PINWHEEL API**
* Designed  and  coded  new  backend  connections  between  Pinwheel  API  and  40+  third-party  platforms  with  the  result  of  increased  consumer  coverage   and  data  quality  for  financial  products  such  as  direct  deposit  automation,  real-time  identity  and  income  verification,  paycheck-linked  lending,  earned-wage  access,  etc.
* Maintained  Pinwheelâ€™s  1.5K+  existing  backend  connections  by  identifying  root  cause  of  production  issues  and  implementing  robust  solutions  or,  when  applicable,  proposing  and  spearheading systemic  solutions,  to  improve  connectionsâ€™  data  quality  and  fault-tolerance.
* Participated  in  a  guild  with  the  outcome  of  improved  technical  understanding  of  monitoring  tools  such  as  Retool  and  Datadog,  and  Amazon  products  such  as  Redshift  and  S3,  as  well  as  improved  cross-team  communication  and  collaboration  and  ownership  over  internal  monitoring  dashboards.


**FULL-STACK SOFTWARE ENGINEER FELLOW | HACKBRIGHT**
* Built  a  full-stack  Python  Flask  web  application  that  allows  Strava  users  to  visualize  and  filter  their  activities  on  an  interactive  JS  Leaflet  map  as  well  as  customize  the  appearance  of  the  map  and  to  create,  read,  update,  delete  training  goals  and  their  respective  training  plans  on  a  JS  FullCalendar  calendar.
* Managed  the  software  development  life  cycle  of  a  full-stack  web  application,  including  planning  and  documentation  with  tools  such  as  wireframes  and  source  control (Git  &  Github).
* Explored  and  analyzed  a  variety  of  API  documentations,  completing  testing  through  Postman.
* Collaborated  with  cohort  mates  in  30+  pair-programming  sessions,  resulting  in  improved  technical  communication  skills,  faster  comprehension  of  a  code  base,  and the  ability  to  quickly  analyze,  investigate,  and  solve  bugs  in  the  code  of  others.
* Participated  in  two  2-week  sprints  and  daily  scrum  meetings  during  project  season  in  order  to  simulate  exposure  to  scrum  and  agile  development  methodologies. 

**HR GENERALIST | SANOFI**
