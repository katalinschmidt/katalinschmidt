### Ãœdv! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡º ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

My name is Katalin. I am a full-stack software engineer with a non-traditional background.

My strengths as a developer today are defined by my former lives as an educator and HR admin. <br>
ðŸ’¬ Reach out and ask me how those jobs have translated into some of these great traits I work with today:
* Mindful of a companyâ€™s big picture
* First-hand experience with the benefits of - and thus, major appreciation for - automation in the workplace
* Focused on the end-user & human-experience
* Mindful of accessibility and delivery
* Regularly evaluating the what and the why
* Outstanding ability to communicate (be it reasoning, logic, or technical topics)
* Proven ability to break complex things down
* Detail-oriented
* Results-oriented
* Hungry to learn

I thrive in environments where I am continually being asked to learn and have a sense of ownership over the given product or service. I feel especially rewarded when I know that my work is having a direct, positive impact on someone else's day - be that an employee of a company where new technologies are being implemented or an end-user of an application. Bonus points if I can collaborate with a team that has great mentorship and diversity.
